# 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of our solar system, built using the Three.js library. It features the Sun, planets (including Earth with its Moon), an asteroid belt, and solar flares.

## Features

*   **Celestial Bodies:** Includes the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth (with Moon), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (with rings), Uranus, and Neptune.
*   **Asteroid Belt:** A procedurally generated asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
*   **Solar Flares:** Animated solar flares emanating from the Sun's surface.
*   **Interactive Camera:** Orbit controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the view.

## Demo

To view the simulation, open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL and ES modules.

## Instructions

*   **Navigation:** Use the mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera.
* **Choose Planet**: In the top left you can click on the "Choose Planet" button and select a planet from the list to focus the camera on it.

## Libraries
